# orbpy
Simple orbit propagation in Python

I wrote this (very quickly) in support of
[estpy](http://www.github.com/rwilson4/estpy). No person in their
right mind would actually use this propapagator as a propagator!
Instead it is just meant to illustrate the usage of estpy. Anyone is
free to use estpy with their own
propagator. [poliastro](http://docs.poliastro.space/en/latest/index.html)
seems like a good starting point. Although honestly, now that I'm
actually looking at various Python propagators, they all seem just as
simple as mine. If anyone can point me to a propagator that can take
into account the non-spherical Earth, Sun/Moon effects, drag, light
radiation, etc., let me know!
